Portfolio submission for homework 2
This is my submission for homework 2. I utilized advice given to others within slack, YouTube videos, and tutorials online to develop my website. I have included an about me section, portfolio section (which is mostly fabricated as I do not have many creations to add to it), and a contact section (the buttons and submission options do not actually provide any function, as I am unsure of how to do this, however I do not believe it is required.)
